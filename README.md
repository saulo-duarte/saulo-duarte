## About Me
I'm a computer science student working to develop skills in data engineering. My focus is on learning how to build and optimize data pipelines, work with databases, and use tools that transform data into useful information.

I have an interest in open-source projects and appreciate the collaborative environment they provide. My goal is to improve as a data engineer while contributing to the community when possible
